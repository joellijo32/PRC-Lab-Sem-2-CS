S2 PRC LAB CYCLE 1 (KTU 2024 Scheme): 


1. Find the roots of a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. (if .. else)
2. Input a date in the format dd/mm/yyyy and validate it. (switch)
3. Find the GCD and LCM of two numbers. (while / do ..while)
4. Find the largest and smallest of a set of N numbers. (for)
5. Input a binary number and display the decimal equivalent of that number. (while /do
.. while)
6. Display the perfect numbers in first N counting numbers. ( nested loop)
7. Display the first N prime numbers. (nested loop)

CYCLE 2 : 

8. Search for a particular number in a list of N numbers using linear search. Display
the position of the number in the list if the number is present. Otherwise display
suitable message.
9. Display the binary equivalent of an unsigned decimal integer. (using 1-D array)
10. Sort N integers in ascending order using bubble sort algorithm.
11. Search for a number in a sorted list of numbers using binary search.
12. Given two sets (mathematical set) of numbers A and B. Find A U B, A âˆ©B, A-B.
13.Given two sorted list of numbers. Merge these two lists to form a new list such that the
resultant list is also in sorted order. (do the operation without further sorting).
